When SigCal is launched, it ask for two float inputs: Bottom var[iable] & Top var[iable].
Bottom Variable is equal to 'x', and Top variable is equal to 'y'. See fig 1.
'i[0]' is the function which will be operated on 'x'. See fig 1.

# Changing i[0]
i[0] is hard coded into the program. You can change it by using an text editor or IDE (some good ones are pycharm and nano).
Open SigCal.py and look inside the 'sigma()' function. There you will find the list 'i[]'
i[0] does the physical calculation on 'x'. i[1] is a string that is returned when the 'func' command is used.
